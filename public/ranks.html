                    <h2>Rank Requirements</h2>
                    <div class="news-subheading">To promote skill and hard work, we have established our own rank system. Some ranks have certain privileges tied to them, but most are to showcase one's achievements in AX combat. To apply for a certain rank, you need to present a proof of your achievement in tea-and-medals and state which rank you are applying for.</div>
                    <div class="news-subheading">Send your Screenshot or video to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/380246809076826112/417398561391509504"><span class="axiorange">#tea-and-medals</span></a> channel in the AXI Discord to apply for a rank!</div>
                    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Conditions and Rules</button>
                    <div class="terms">
                        <h3>General Points</h3>
                        <p>Do not ping anyone to review your submission, it will be processed when possible. If your submission was not processed within 48 hours, you are allowed to contact a staff member about it.</p>
                        <p>The proof has to be a <span class="axiorange">screenshot</span>, or a <span class="axiorange">video</span>, and has to clearly show the interceptor death explosion, the "bond received" message and other parts of ship UI such as the Ship Health and Radar.</p>
                        <img style="object-fit: cover; width: 60%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; margin-bottom: 1rem;" src="https://axicdn.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images/km2_explosion.png" alt="">
                        <p>Below are descriptions and requirements of the main progression ranks, which require you to not receive any help from NPCs or players not in your wing, and as such cannot be achieved in AX Conflict Zones. Use of a Ship Launched Fighter piloted by NPC is permitted. When applying for a solo rank you must not be in a wing.</p>
                        <p class="axiorange">Use of any bugs, exploits, cheats or other methods of killing the interceptor in an unintended way (including gibbing) is forbidden, and such submissions will be rejected.</p>
                        <h3>Prohibited weapons</h3>
                        <p>Weapons listed below are not valid for rank submissions, this is due to balance issues or the weapons being no longer available to obtain. Salvation modified gauss cannons 'Hammergauss' are only allowed if proof of basic ammo usage is provided. Standard and premium ammo is bugged, and therefore prohibited.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Advanced Missile Racks</li>
                            <li>Salvation CG Long range Shard cannons</li>
                            <li>CG double ammo capacity heatsinks</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Mutual Destruction</h3>
                        <p>In the event of a pilot getting the kill but dying in the process, a kill is valid for a rank only if the Interceptor explodes before your ship does. This does not apply to timed runs.</p>
                        <h3>Speedrun Timing</h3>
                        <p>Speed runs are timed using the in-game clock. Timer starts at the first shot fired and ends when the bond popup occurs. As such, the in-game clock must be visible when the first shot is fired, as well as when the bond pops up.</p>
                        <h3>Soaring Sleipnir</h3>
                        <p>HUD must be turned off or external camera enabled before the first shot is fired, and it must remain that way until after the Interceptor has exploded. Bond popup and Ship Radar are not required for this rank.</p>
                        <h3>Wing Kills</h3>
                        <p>When submitting a proof for a wing kill, make sure to @ping all of the other participants in tea-and-medals. Multi-Crew <b>DOES</b> count for wing ranks.</p>
                        <h3>Duo Ranks</h3>
                        <p>All Duo Rank submissions must show both participants are actively inside the instance when the Interceptor dies.</p>

                            <p>Commander John Jameson can be considered the first AX hunter. He fought during the First Thargoid War and played an instrumental role in ending it, saving uncountable lives. Some may wish to undertake a pilgrimage of sorts, to the place of his demise and discover the story first-hand. For this rank we require you to bring an Guardian Relic, a Thargoid Link, and a Damaged Escape Pod to John Jameson's crash site and provide a screenshot of all of them laid out next to his ship.</p>
