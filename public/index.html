                                <p>Now that we have built a good portfolio of <span class="axiorange">"challenge ranks,"</span> testing a variety of advanced AX skills, we wanted to further recognize CMDRs who achieve them all.</p>
                                <p>Much like <span class="axiorange">@Collector</span> is achieved by "Collecting" most progression ranks (including getting Herculean Warrior together with another <span class="axiorange">@Collector</span>), we are now formalizing the "Club10" informal designation by launching a special <span class="axiorange">@Decent Pilot</span> designation; <span class="axiorange">@Decent Pilot</span> is a meta-rank that will be automatically granted to CMDRs who have been been awarded all ten challenge ranks. It has no color, by design, but it allows to display a medal next to your name. This idea builds on the long-running informal list of Club7/8/etc (which grew as we added challenges to our ranks.)</p> 
                                <p>Furthermore, given the exceptional nature of such accomplishment, CMDRs earning <span class="axiorange">@Decent Pilot</span> will be individually recognized in our #hall-of-fame channel.</p>
                                <p>Contextually, and in consideration of the fact that we have not held a Ceres Trial in a while, we will be retiring the @Ceres Medal rank, and the formerly-known-as Ceres Medal will now be assigned to our ... Decent Pilots!</p>
                                <p>Glory, To Mankind!</p>

                                <p>The Thargoids have returned in great force pushing large incursions into multiple human-occupied systems. Commanders abroad have been requested to aid with the defence, rescue and logistical efforts.</p>
                                <p>response to this latest push in Thargoid activity, the <span class="axiorange">Anti-Xeno Initiative</span> has commissioned a new tracking and monitoring system to allow commanders to keep up-to-date with the latest movements and presence statuses of incursion systems.</p>

We will discuss Anti Xeno combat and see if, among other things, we can get Bruce his first (wing) rank (Zac already has it)</p>
                                <p>Agenda is fluid but we expect to spend some time talking about AX before jumping into combat ... for all multi-goid fans we'll also be bringing meta-alloys to see if we can get an interceptor to invite a friend to the party.</p>
                                <p>Also, we will do our best to NOT follow in the footprints of our glorious founder, and die on stream to a clops, but there are no guarantees...</p>
                                <p>Join us tomorrow on Twitch to listen in, participate, and have some AX fun!</p>

We defend systems targeted by the vile xenos, study their technology and behavior, and perfect our battle tactics. Whether you seek to save the galaxy, kill some aliens, conduct research, or hone your skills, you will find help here.</p>

                        <p>The <span class="axiorange">Anti-Xeno Initiative</span> was founded by <span class="axiorange">CMDR Gluttony Fang</span> on 15th of November 3303. We are the largest dedicated AX (Anti-Xeno) player group in Elite:Dangerous and act as a hub for the broader AX Community. We are partnered with <span class="axiorange">Canonn Research</span>, who provide us with the latest findings related to our mission. We also coordinate defense efforts with other player groups to protect as many lives as we can. We constantly strive to get better at what we do and we have some of the best Anti-Xeno experts among us.</p>
                        <p>The membership in AXI is non-binding, meaning you can also be a part of any other player group you wish. We have people of all walks of life and all matter of allegiance. We ourselves are a completely independent and apolitical - we do not support or oppose any faction, power or group, unless they force our hand. That said, we protect our members. We have a sizable contingent of PvP pilots to repel any attempts at disrupting our primary mission.</p>
